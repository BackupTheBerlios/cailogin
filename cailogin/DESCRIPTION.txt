CAILogin (Counter AI Login) is an image-based user verification program for web-page logins. It's written in plain C with no special dependencies, and hence it's very suitable for embedded systems which lack "big" interpreted languages, such as PHP, Python or Perl. It features a command line interface, which enables it to be utilized from within regular shell scripts.

It works by generating true random numbers, on which later applies several obscuration filters. The end result is an image from which is very difficult to extract the displayed number.
