* Short term *

comment code a little bit
prepare a man page
support blurring filter
support rotation filter
support scalling filter
DB file locking (is it needed?)

* Long term *

clean up code a bit
logging for debuging
command line switch to print compile time options (directory locations, supported things, etc)
./configure
move cleanupDB() calls from main to file.c
report to syslog
use assert for catching errors
support for multiple fonts (packed in tar balls, gzip compressed) (needs libtar, libz)
variable width strings
support letters in addition to numbers
support other image formats (png, gif, jpeg, tiff)

* Questionable *

support configuration file? (which filters to use)
support more filters, which? (geometrical transformations)
Deamonalize? (Interprocess communication wich client program, db in memmory, signal.h)
support font generation mode? (by using heuristics or neural networks or something)
