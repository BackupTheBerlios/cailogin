* Short term *

provide a way to set the likelyhood of each filter
introduce mututal exclusive filters
support blurring filter
support rotation filter
support scalling filter

* Long term *

prepare a man page
comment code a little bit
logging for debuging
command line switch to print compile time options (directory locations, supported things, etc)
./configure (with filter enable/disable options)
move cleanupDB() calls from main to file.c
use assert for catching errors
support for multiple fonts (packed in tar balls, gzip compressed) (needs libtar, libz)
variable width strings
support letters in addition to numbers
support other image formats, optionally (png, gif, jpeg, tiff)

* Questionable *

DB file locking (is it needed?)
report to syslog?
support configuration file? (which filters to use)
support more filters, which? (geometrical transformations)
Deamonalize? (Interprocess communication wich client program, db in memmory, signal.h)
support font generation mode? (by using heuristics or neural networks or something)
