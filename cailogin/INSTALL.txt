*** SYSTEM-WIDE ***

As usual:
	make
	make install

To install on a non-standard directory type:
	make PREFIX=<path/to/route/dir> install

Default installation directories are:
	cailogin -> /usr/local/bin/
	cailogin.db -> /var/lib/cailogin/
	cailogin.cgi -> /var/www/localhost/cgi-bin/
	bitmaps/* -> /var/lib/cailogin/bitmaps/

*** USER-SPECIFIC ***

You will have to change some variables in Makefile before installing. As an example of
user-space installation, try:
	make -f Makefile.example
	cp -a example /wherever/you/want/
But be warned that this is not a secure installation. System-wide installation, is the
most secure option.
